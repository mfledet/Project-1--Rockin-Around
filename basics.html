                <strong>A</strong>lthough it has been around for years, rock climbing became popular between 1920-1960. Its popularity has increased over the years as more individuals climbed cliffs that were thought to be impossible, such as Yosemite Valley and the Swiss Alps. </p>

                <strong>R</strong>ock climbing has progressed in such a way that there are now more then a few types of climbing. Some of these include:
                <ul>
                    <li> <strong> Free Solo Climbing</strong> = climbing without any protection such as a harness or a belay. If the individual falls, they are likely to be injured and even killed </li>
                    <li> <strong>Bouldering</strong> =climbing on short rock walls without the need for harness or rope. A <em>blouldering pad</em> (which is essentially a huge cushion) is placed beneath the climber to prevent any injuries</li>
                    <li> <strong>Free Climbing</strong> = this type of climbing has grown to be the most popular out of all of the different types of rock climbing. It is divided into 2 types: Sport Climbing and Traditional (Trad) Climbing
